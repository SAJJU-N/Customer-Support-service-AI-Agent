ü§ñ Customer Support Service AI AgentThis project implements a fully automated, AI-powered customer support service using the n8n workflow automation platform. The agent automatically receives, classifies, and intelligently replies to incoming customer support emails, significantly reducing human effort and improving response times.üí° The Problem & The SolutionAspectDescriptionThe ProblemManual handling of high-volume customer emails is time-consuming, inefficient, and often involves support teams reading, classifying, and replying to repetitive queries. This directly impacts response time and customer satisfaction.The SolutionWe developed an AI-driven agent that automates the entire process: read $\rightarrow$ classify $\rightarrow$ generate reply $\rightarrow$ send. The workflow is built end-to-end using n8n, making it scalable and easy to maintain.‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Architecture & How It WorksThis n8n workflow leverages several key nodes and APIs to create a seamless automation loop:Gmail Trigger: The workflow is initiated instantly upon receiving a new incoming email in the designated support inbox.Text Classifier: The email content is analyzed by an AI model to classify the query type (e.g., Product Inquiry, Complaint, Feature Request, Feedback).Pinecone Vector Store (RAG): The agent checks a Pinecone vector database for relevant past queries or official documentation. This Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach ensures the AI maintains context and provides consistent, high-quality responses.AI Agent (OpenRouter Chat Model): Based on the classification and retrieved context, the AI (via the OpenRouter API) generates an accurate, polite, and personalized reply message.Reply Message Node: The generated response is automatically sent back to the customer via the Gmail API, completing the feedback loop.!‚ú® Key FeaturesFull Automation: 24/7 autonomous handling of customer support emails.AI-Driven Classification: Accurate categorization of diverse query types.Context-Aware Responses: Utilizes the Pinecone Vector Store and RAG for intelligent, informed replies.Scalability: Designed to handle real-world operational loads and easily integrate with existing CRM systems.Efficient & Cost-Effective: Demonstrates a practical application of AI + automation for reducing operational costs.üíª Tech StackTool/ServiceRole in Projectn8nPrimary platform for building and executing the automation workflow (Low-Code/No-Code).OpenRouter APIInterface for accessing powerful AI Chat Models for text classification and response generation.Google Gmail APIUsed for triggering the workflow and sending the final automated reply.Pinecone Vector DatabaseStores and retrieves context (past queries, documents) for the RAG pipeline.Google Gemini EmbeddingsUsed to create the vector representations of data stored in the Pinecone database.üöÄ Getting Started (Setup)To run this workflow, you will need the following credentials:n8n Instance: Self-hosted or Cloud.OpenRouter API Key: For the AI Agent.Gmail/Google OAuth Credentials: To access the support mailbox.Pinecone API Key & Environment: For the Vector Store.Gemini API Key: For generating the embeddings
